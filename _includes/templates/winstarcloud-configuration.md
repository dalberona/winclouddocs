## WinstarCloud configuration

**Note** WinstarCloud configuration steps are necessary only in case of **local WinstarCloud installation**.
If you are using [**Live Demo**](https://demo.winstarcloud.io/) instance all entities are pre-configured for your demo account.
However, we recommend reviewing this steps because you will still need to get device access token to send requests to WinstarCloud.
